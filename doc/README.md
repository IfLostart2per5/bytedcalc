# Structure
The program is organized based on two arrays:
  - the pre-included values, that is more simple to use
  - the instructions

 the pre-included values is a set of values that can be directly consumed. Example (in a "pseudo-assembly")  
 ```
# it a simple program that sums two numbers
values:
  5
  4
instructions:
  load val;
  load val;
  sum;
  end;
```
